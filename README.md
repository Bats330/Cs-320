When making a program the are concerns about making my code functional and secure some ways that I like to tackle this is by taking a look at the requirements and working on those in a way that 
all of the requirements are met in the most simple/precise way to ensure they are getting accomplished in the program in a more effienct way. To ensure that this code is all secure and functional
Is that I run differnt types off tests against the code throughout development to make sure all of the sections/blocks of code are functioning as they should and funbctioning as a whole functioning program.

When working on development on a program I will take the requirements set by the user and break them into smaller tasks that way I can tackle each piece sepertly to ensure every piece of the users needs
is worked into my program. I do this since for me it is easier to make sure each part of the requirement gets its respective amount of attention to detail and gets added to the project.

In ways both of the prievouse blocks of text above is ways I approach designing software I like to set up a building block of goals to work through to ensure that the software I design is
my best piece of work that I can do to my best abilities this is done by trying to meet all of the requirements and simply testing the code to ensure it works.
